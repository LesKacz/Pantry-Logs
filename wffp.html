  <!-- Wireframe for Pantry Project  

 I had no idea what a developer log or wireframes were. I learned
 stuff in Mod 2, but it was hard because I did not learn much 
 in Mod 1. So putting a program together was a big challenge. 
 It would be like me saying,"take that car engine apart and 
 put it back together” and I walk away. I would come back and
  you’d be huh!!! 

I looked at a pantry that had to many of one item and not
 enough of a different one. I then thought I bet there is 
 a project in JS for this. There were shopping lists but 
 not an actual Pantry Inventory projects to watch. 

I went ok add something and give a qty . I also wanted
 to add a product by category and price. I know the price 
 would change, but it would be close enough to have a general 
 idea of the list of items you’d need. 

When I need to do something I don't write everything down .
 I JUST DO IT! Here are the LinKs you wanted.
