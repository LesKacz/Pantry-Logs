/* Developer Log 

1. I wanted something to make to add and subtract from pantry so I  

    don't have to always look. 

2. I watched videos, found the ones I liked and watched the videos. 

3. I watched a few started coding with the different ones. 

4. I mixed them up and added some took away some. 

5. If I had the extra 20 hours, I want to be able to put in  

    the initial quantities and then as I remove one it subtracts it. 

    After shopping it adds it.  

6. I've worked on it and I am close but not finished on the new changes 

    I had already thought of things before you suggested them. But Thanks. 

7. It is better than the one I turned in.I was on a deadline . 

8. The problem with these projects is I did not learn  

    anything UNTIL I watched UDEMY and especially TECH WITH TIM! 

That young man is FANTASTIC. I was amazed how he goes  

step by step and explains why and what for.
